		<h1>Why the Advance program?</h1>
		<p>Health, or ability to improve it, should be free. I developed “Advance” as a follow-up to my first program “Level-Up” in the <a id="textLink" href="https://www.nike.com/ntc-app">Nike Training App</a>.</p>
		<p>However, for this program you needed to be in certain parts of the world or else you couldn’t get it. I also wanted to give you direct access to me to help you get the most out of these workouts.</p>
		<p>So I created an open source website that allows anyone to participate and aim for improved health in these crazy times. I want you to text me and ask me questions/feedback. I’ll be hosting seminars I want you to join. Don’t have weights? That’s cool there will be bodyweight versions on <a id="textLink" href="https://www.instagram.com/exercise_snacks/?hl=en">Exercise Snacks</a>.</p>
		<p>I am putting the tools in your hands. Take control of your health. This is all free. LET’S GO. </p>
		<h1>How does it work?</h1>
		<p>It is an 8 week program that will help you improve your athleticism but also your health knowledge. Over the course of 8 weeks you will have 4 stages that are composed of 6 workouts. Every 2 weeks you will complete 6 workouts with options to engage in exercise on your rest/recovery days.  Minimal equipment is required, you only need dumbbells and a jump rope.</p>
		<p>This program is focused on improving multiple components of your fitness including mobility, strength, and endurance to make you a complete athlete while still being accessible for all skill levels.</p>
		<p>If you’re already in the United States, UK, and Mexico and want to get involved just download the app <a id="textLink" href="https://www.nike.com/ntc-app">here</a> or click below for more information. If you are outside of the United States click below. I have open-sourced the workouts and the first stage is available NOW.</p>
