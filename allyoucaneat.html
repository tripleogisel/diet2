				<h2>03.30.17 - instagram shopping + unrelated hidden “fewer” feature</h2>
				<p class="course">instagram launched or beta launched or something a new web view for eCommerce that displays photos in an almost-instagram like grid but it breathes a little bit more to facilitate shopping. when you open the shopping view one of the top things is a field to enter your email address and stay “up to date” on [insert account name here]’s latest whatever. i opened the web view with the link in bio, and assume it’s possible on a story’s “swipe up”, too. I had hoped it was possible to somehow go directly from an image to the “shopping” web view for that specific item… pretty sure that’s impossible today. <br><br> BUT! Alas, I discovered something totally hidden that is kinda useful. When you’re on the “bio” view for an account, you can press (hard AF!) on an image and bring up this all new page with an X in the top right hand corner next to “following”. if you tap the X it immediately delivers a quasi-“success” message explaining that instagram will show you “fewer” posts “like this”. Not sure what that means exactly, but it’s an interesting move in the world of instagram that’s built on a “you can follow me but i don’t have to follow you” model. </p>

				<h2>03.28.17 - Google Forms - Add Collaborator... "folks"</h2>
				<p class="course">Google Forms “add collaborator” functionality, like most sharing-related features out there, makes like difficult. I have added 5 collaborators so far in groups of 2 or as even one at a time. I'm about to send this access out to someone new when I notice a pre-checked "Notify people" checkbox next to an "Add message" link, all below the "Email address" field for the newest collaborator I seek to add. If I enter a message, will everyone receive it, or is it just the new person? Who knows! <br><br> I decide to play it safe and uncheck the box. <br><br> But, when I finally attempt to add the collaborator I receive a cryptic error response about how “folks will have to sign in before they notice what I've shared”. Who are these folks?! Sign into what?! C’mon google, where else do you have folks out there?</p>

				<h2>03.19.17 - uber's small bet on the refund experience</h2>
				<p class="course"> Uber bets that easy refunds will help improve customer retention as new comptetitors continue to pop up. The following breaks down one of the best if not THE best refund experiences I have ever had, on moible no less. uber goes the route to trust users - i received a credit in seconds. *checks email* - *sees cancellation fee email from uber* - *sees “mistake?” - app part of email* - *opens and navigate to past trips* - *taps i was incorrectly charged a cancellation fee* - *taps my driver cancelled* - *receives money back* <br><br>
				How does a company that <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/news/2016/12/02/uber-losses.html">loses hundreds of millions every year</a> offer customers such a lenient refund experience? Who knows, but I would expect to see more stuff like this from uber as their image continues to suffer. If revenue goes up, it doesn't matter if they're losing money right now.

				<h2>03.10.17 - confused in Grailed</h2>
				<p class="course"> This view confused me a bit. with 2 dark buttons in the ez-2-tap “heat zone”, you figure one of them has to be the primary call to action. it’s possible and maybe even likely that there’s iOS guidelines i don’t know well enough that say the primary CTA always goes in the top right and corner but that doesn’t make any sense in this case. a small text only “apply” button vs. “View filters” and “save filters”. All i wanted to do was apply my filter but i bounced around the view and save worlds before i even noticed the apply button.

				<h2>03.05.17 - hidden actions, Shazam</h2>
				<p class="course"> I’m well-aware this is an underlying iOS problem, but Shazam seems like a great place to change everything. I’m in the My Shazam area, and when i swipe a song right-2-left to reveal underlying actions, “Delete” is the only choice. Personally, I don’t think I have ever deleted a Shazam track. Did Shazam dig into their data and find that people delete songs more than anything else? Doubt it… why is this not a series of share-specific actions -  Text Message, Email, copy & paste, whatever. People want to do this, and it’s gotta be the best possible thing anyone can do in terms of the success for Shazam.
