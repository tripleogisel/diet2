            <div class="story"> Anyone paying attention notices the scent of YAM$ that still permeates throughout the music industry. We're talking about A$AP Mob and its members but also artists not technically in it. Bodega Bamz sheds light on the how YAM$ influenced him and some other personal anecdotes you wont hear anywhere else. Great opportunity to learn more about the mastermind that isn't here to witness ALL of the fruits of his labor. Is anyone? Hinkie isn't.

            <div class="story"> A lot of people and companies triumph the 'new' - the ability to reinvent yourself over and over again, year after year... season after season. Fashion and automobiles are 2 industires that come to mind here. Less people and companies triumph the 'old' by way of long lasting products. It's all but guaranteed that EVERYTHING that ANYONE makes will become waste one day, but that drive to last as long is possible interests me. Some ~new brands (Noah) and some old brands (Visvim, below) champion lifetime products. Stuff that lasts not only in the sense that it's well-made and durable but also in the sense that it transcends the "years" and "seasons" that dictate so much of what we see produced for the world today. Better yet, these lifetime products evolve with us as a result of use. That's beautiful my Gs.

            <div class="story"> It's 2016 and A$AP Mob feels different. Bari built a hideout / fort / skate park / pop up shop on the west coast. It's interesting to consider what aspects of the plan have YAM$ fingerprints. I feel like lots would say it all does in some sense but that not possible. MOB gave a huge knod to Soundcloud leading up to when it introduced it's "Go" $9.99 per month subscription product. Everything started with Yams fest this year but in the last month we have Bari blowing VLONE out with this new set up. Twelvy selling out shows in 15+ cities as the opener for Flatbush Zombies. Nast HAS A STRANGLEHOLD on all of Europe where he's about to tour 20+ cities between London and Moscow. Skeppy wont not bring Ladies Hit Squad to Europe. YAM$ influenced em all but they're all out there... except for Rocky and Ferg - they don't do shit.

            <div class="story"> Do we remember the South Park spoofing of Kanye West from long ago? I
                                ask because in hindsight (like many of Kanyes moments) it was a
                                seminole moment in the atmosphere. How are some of those guys that
                                were photographed doing now? (Don’t have to answer that). The point of
                                this discussion is when you do something different, people are waiting
                                to tell you that you were a fool for stepping out from the status quo.

                                I needed to cool off after my lowly, and beloved Sixers fired the man
                                with his hand on the rudder, the guy who was navigating his way
                                through the shit-storm left by previous leadership. The 13page letter
                                he submitted upon resignation was really a manifesto to progress
                                thought within sports, but it is applicable to life. I mean his
                                citations include Warren Buffett, Abraham Lincoln, Elon Musk, Charlie
                                Munger and Bill Gates among others. He talks about zigging when others
                                zag and taking the longview in an industry that favors immediate
                                impact. But don’t just take my word for it, read for yourself. Hope
                                this finds you well…

                                  say anything profound or that we didn't already know, but the strength
                                  is his articulation and the crux of this discussion. That being, be
                                  your own lane, nothing less nothing more. It dabbles with the idea of
                                  staying true to your authentic self and not fixating on ‘what is in’.
                                  In fact, I think that that phrase is literally the funniest thing
                                  about fashion. Can we imagine being told okay this is cool, now that
                                  is cool. Don't tell me anything.

When i grew up playing basketball kids used to say "Kobe!" when taking a shot. I feel like he's alone in that category - meaning that I don't know about any other athlete in any sport who's referred to in that setting.  Kids didn't say it as a verb ... it's like a feeling, a reference to Kobe's visceral DNA. Kids feel better about the shot even if they only say "Kobe!" in their heads. There has never been a finale like this and I know i'm not wrong. I don't even know if I believe in the illuminati anymore. What else can I say but what he said at the end of his postgame speech at center court? "Mamba out."</div>

I have never seen anything like this - i'm watching it on mute (shoutout to the roommate asleep).

An italian film company released a mini 5 minute documentary about his lesser known color photography projects from the 1960s to 1980s. It's well-done and a nice introduction to Daido (which i neeeded). You may well see a whim street photography project focused on the anonymous members of landlocked cities Atlanta and Chicago.</div>

Somehow in this age of streaming i find ways to pay for all the services, I want all the access. For the 1st time ever Soundcloud now offers ad-free, offline listening "from top 40 to the underground. takeoff to touchdown" for $9.99 a month - they threw a party feat. A$AP Ferg and Chance the Rapper to announce the new service. Subscription everything. Coincidence that A$AP Mob has been flooding Soundcloud with amazing new content every Wednesday for the last 2 months? Ha! This almost feels like a Steve Rodriguez plot.. It will be interesting to see what Soundcloud becomes down the road - it's so big for different musical cultures all over the planet. Atlanta alone is blowing the fuck up out of Soundcloud, define "Soundcloud Rappers". The company based in Berlin - I hope it prioritizes the listening experience above all else. All i want to do is queue.</div>

            <div class="story">This post can be easily equated to the relationship of Nate Britt and Kris “Big Smooth” Jenkins, similar to the two writers on this blog they are “brothers”. This game was a dozy, lead changes, ties, big shots answered by bigger shots including a the first 3pt buzzer beater to win a national championship. I will head up the Nova write-up as I lived my childhood in the shadow of the pavilion on the main line in Philly. Jay Wright and crew really had a team that reflects the toughness of Philly basketball, there is just a certain tenacity Philadelphians are born with. Anyway, thought the game was really good for college basketball to have teams of this type of make-up (non-1 and doners) to battle in a legendary game. It was a tough one for me emotionally, mad love to the heels. //// i’m from buffalo and know what it’s like to lose sports games in heart breaking fashion. I went to unc chapel hill and love the ‘heels but it’s not the same for me as buffalo - not even close. But for 100000s of other people it’s on that level …  I watched that buzzer beater in the heart of the university of nose candy’s campus (chapel hill) on a gigantic projector people of all ages that cried and freaked the fuck out.  but, i was smiling kind of because i don’t know how to get super mad about most shit like that - i knew it wasn’t the Bills and I knew that shit was over - no lawless celebration in the streets... only assholes and tears. Drove back to Atlanta overnight immediately (shout out to PARIS,IL soundcloud for DJing my bumfuck NC, SC, GA pitch black drive).</div>

People might be sleeping on Raury because he wasn't in the Yeezy fashion show. Not sure what's going on here but Raury is mega -- I cannot wait for him to put out a big comprehensive project. This LVRN works for now, I guess. Rap and Hip-Hop delivered through the kaleidascope that is Raury's brain. Special guest is D.R.A.M. here... yea that dude who's name you may not know but who made you "like to cha cha" and "get off your ass and get money". Whoaaaaa. PS - Kanye dropped a song tonight go find that if you can.</div>

            <div class="story">TOPSAFE London first caught my eye with <a href="http://www.anewplace2drown.com">the website</a> that introduced Archy Marshall's comprehensive project, A New Place 2 Drown. I knew Zoo Kid, djjdsports, edgar the beat maker, and of courwse King Krule. But, A New Place 2 Drown offered a visceral look at the man behind it all - Archy. The site and project as a whole personified Archy and his biggest influences - namely, the people in his life. TOPSAFE London Est. 2009 is a creative agency that demonstrates a refreshing perspective on production value. It's most recent addition to TOPSAFE TV hit home for me. I hung on every word of the instagram caption that described the project. Time moved slower when I watched the 4 minute short film, maybe. As Oliver Reichenstein says - "Slow. The. Fuck. Down." So much to discover here.</div>

Edgar remixes 3 tracks on the tape. Were there original versions? Does it matter? I'm not going to spend the time doing that because this mixtape is super pointy. Burlington knows what i'm talking about. Oh and Ant Rocky and Nast dropped a heater for old time sake - wavy wednesdays as usual.</div>

            <div class="story">"We don’t write about surfing per se – we use it as an entry point about more general topics to talk about culture, science, art, life." A team of 3 guys with different day jobs (as far as i know) started Acid Magazine. It's a phenomenal visual project that the team designed to make readers feel like their surfing. It's interesting how they use surfing to share their perspective on the rest of life. It's a beautiful intersection of sport and life. "It's a sensual thing". The team behind Acid Magazine created something to inspire people and highlight a culture of surfing outside of its traditional commercialized realm. I love projects like this - it aligns with what we do at WHiM in a lot of ways. I'm vv excited to receive volumes 2 3 and 4 in the next few days and will share more some time after that, maybe.</div>

            <div class="story">Some stuff about Nike as a business bothers me. HTM is not one of those things. I love the essence of HTM. It's a special projects team without a budget, business constraints, to-do lists, deadlines - all the whack shit. HTM is s team of 3 people with vastly different backgrounds who come together to create whatever they want whenever they want - no (bad) pressure ... SO much good pressure. It would be difficult to trace how projects from HTM affect the bottom line for Nike. But, given who's on the team, it's clear to me that HTM work is as relevant if not more relevant than any cost-cutting anything that can boost profits or cut costs. Super important.</div>

            <div class="story">30 for 30 sports documentaries are some of my favorite pieces of visual media. The 30 for 30 on the duke lacrosse case was one of my favorite editions of the series, it was enlightening and pertinent to the current times. After watching I dove into literature both present and past to better understand the situation and more so the snap reaction, how the media misinformed the public when everything happened. Below the link is an amazing piece by ESPNs Jason Whitlock from 2006, check it out. I think what is most important here is the context of race and understanding that in current culture. It’s so important to formulate your own opinion if you work in media. Journalists must remain grounded in their own takes and opinions.</div>

End of post.<br><br> But really, Tadao Ando is an amazing artist whose work has been truly inspiring for myself specifically on my thoughts on materials. It is important to regard materials in your creative pursuits, sometimes the design comes first sometimes the material is the first thing to resonate. Tadao is working more and more in the United States, which is delightful to me, we need to integrate the world’s best architects to work on spaces in this country, the perspective is important. Take a look at some of his work and then walk outside, don’t think.</div>

            <div class="story">SHEESH! “Yo Young Thug! You have the best references!" The first time I heard Young Thug I was blasting "Danny Glover" on repeat parked at Kroger in Buckhead, Atlanta ... <a href="http://www.gq.com/story/young-thug-best-rapper-alive-interview">(nowhere near where Young Thug grew up with 11 brothers and sisters)</a> ... Today, ~3 years later, there's 1000s of Young Thug tracks from his GROSS portfolio of albums, mixtapes and features. He’s one of the most, if not the most, prolific rapper right now. Super artistic when you boil it down - when anyone listens to him, looks at him, they feel something … and that’s what’s so impressive. <a href="https://www.thefader.com/2016/03/23/elton-john-young-thug-meet">Elton John</a> compares him to John Lennon. Thug says he’s from another planet - <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x374r30">“that other Earth </a> - they (Nasa) found” and I don’t doubt it. Slime Season 3 represents yet another step in an grossly productive 3 years for this dude. Thug’s style and his go-to-market strategy nudge the game. He releases mixtapes faster than Twilight books, or whatever. Da Drought 1-3. Slime Season 1-3. Think Birdman has anything to do wit this? Credit is due nah mean? SHEESH!</div>

Tom Sachs is a god, and sells/does whatever he feels like. One of my favorite Tom Sachs stories comes by way of Heron Preston, who once was serving Mr. Sachs at a restaurant in New York. Tom complemented Heron on his jeweled out Rolex, which he had bought on Canal St., “Nice, watch”, Heron replied, “Thanks, but it’s fake”, Tom then quipped back “No, no it’s not.” That exchange means so much to me, who or what determines what is “real”. I ll just leave that there</div>

Lil Uzi Vert n Playboi Carti shook down Atlanta tonight in a small auditorium called Center Stage late Sunday night. Small venue for 1000 people - Carti brought 100+ on the stage for his entire act. He opened with Ethereal who produced his first public tracks then waved to his Mom and Dad sitting behind the soundboards, “this is a party it ain’t a show”. This was a backyard type of venue for Carti who's out of Atlanta - stupid support levels for this guy. But, Uzi and Rich The Kid all owned the crowd too. Lil Yachty featured on 2 songs and posed on stage which he does so well. Ian smoking in the back of the crowd - wait, is this part of his masterpiece? Wait..</div>

Cold Calls are kind of like dancing in the middle of a room by yourself, it can feel awkward and can go bad very fast. However, if you do something - something will happen. You really don’t know what the outcome of your actions, but the key to success is action. Be about who you say you are! What you think, talk, read, eat, breath about DO that. I don’t want to go without saying, pick a person who you would want to be an apprentice for and align yourself. THANKS GUYS </div>

Tidal wont win under the current industry, it wont grow in this forest, but it's poised to fuck up the whole forest that is streaming music and reshape the industry. Anytime you see Kanye do something don't focus on what he's doing but focus on why he might be doing that - "What could he possibly be up to?". I see Kanye as a calculated mother fucker who makes uber deliberate macro decisions followed by a daily mix of calculated and super-emotional actions.</div>

              <div class="story">"I found this jacket and story super relevant. It's the crux of my creation ideology. I want people to not create with a monetary outlook, rather create because you want explore limits and create something unique that you value personally. The end product in this situation is really awesome. I love the nucleus of Patagonia - how they value worn and weathered clothing. For me they're a pioneer of the apparel lifetime warranty. As great as it is to open a box and to see a new product that gets you excited, it's equally as special relate age to beauty through product.</div>

We saw Travis posses everyone in a 500 person venue during BET Award Weekend in Atlanta. A couple weeks later it's massive sold out shows with The Weeknd on the Madness tour and now (and 4ever?) on Rihanna's tour. He pushes the live product so hard and excels faster than anybody in "music" right now - hands down. Travis Scott takes shit SO seriously. Very similar to Kanye, who he stood next to in MSG all afternoon last Thursday</div>

The Reebok Solider Ices (Skepta says ) are back in full force, goggle vision, pay attention to A$AP Nast - he's a clear A$AP Mob leader becoming more like Yams and Bari every damn day.

This time Stance socks is in on it too (nice move, Stance). They launched a box set including socks and skate wheels trademarked by Lyons' illustrations. </div>

Teton Thai sits at the base of Teton Village (main ski snowboard destination). Assuming the right manager is on duty (conveniently named Thailer) you'll be able to hear its blown out speakers blasting Wu-Tang Clan, Dead Prez or Future. Teton Thai delivers authentic Thai food in its own personally authentic atmosphere. It's small (we'll keep reporting on small places) and you may have to wait to sit down.. but find the indoor patio with counches, a fireplace and space heaters hanging from the ceiling. It's well worht the wait... plus its website is SO LIT!</div>

Drink a free mimosa while you wait for your bags? OK. The architecture is crazy - reverse trusses support an alarming wooden ceiling lit up by defused lights. Chill in a giant love sac or other comfy chairs? OK. For real it’s one of the best airports for none of the reasons most people would say an airport is “the best”. It’s extra refreshing and its design speaks directly to the history and feel of Jackson Hole. The first of infinite reasons to go Jackson.</div>

It makes a stupid amount of sense to align yourself with people that interest you, and it's not that hard turn that interest into a mentorship. Major differences between these 3 guys. Age, education, upbringing, what-ever-else etc. At the same time there’s ONE Vv important similarity to point out. All 3 of them share the common goal to leave a legacy and they trust that the best way to accomplish that is to mentor hungry individuals younger than them. Virgil mentored Bari, Bari mentored Ian. It’s 2016 version of Socrates Aristotle and Plato. Hate them or whatever, but it's beautiful to see contemporary mentorship at work. All 3 are in Paris putting the turd in turtleneck at the 1000th Fashion Week. You can learn a lil sumpin' if you read this interview, specifically the "advice he swears by" section.</div>

              <div class="story"> Skate culture has its fingerprints all over street style. Have all the surfers migrated south? One of the goals of the Earthman tee was to shed light on 90s surf culture by clashing the scene with landlocked cities- ATL CHi; in an attempt to broaden our vision on sportswear. Sports have and will always have a spot at the table of our clothing and our lifestyle, so it felt important for our first project to give a nod to two entities that are central to that. Surfing is similar to skating, in that it is equal parts sport and art, the perfect combination for fellas like ourselves, however surfing has always been behind the curve and not gotten its proper shine in mainstream culture. Earthman brings worlds together, for us earthpeople.</div>

That is a question that all creatives must ask oneself, as presentation holds the same value as the work itself. Archy Marshall effortlessly executes on this difficult part of the equation. Seperating himself from the work in a way that lets his work be loud but delicate simultaneously. This approach must run in the family, as JG (Archy’s brother) designed art that you see on the shirt. Also of note, that the image on the shirt is exactly the size of a CD album, because CDs and physicals are more important than ever in this digital world.</div>

These mixes will be unlike any other divning genres and generations effortlessly. You’ll say “Wait! ___ sampled that in ____” more than once. They’re classic without being nostalgic - also known as perfect. 142 Sullivan (name of the bar and its address) has something special going on. Co-owners Ant Rich and Brian Joffe built a small bar (first win) and used incredible music and design as the foundation. All white brick walls, white painted branches above angled mirrors that hang above the bar, a back wall lined with vinyls between Jay-Z Reasonable Doubt to Rolling Stones - Some Girls, to Vane Russo’s collages in the way back - 142 Sullivan has it going-the-fuck-on.</div>

PARIS, IL (dj duo of Guillaume Berg and Virgil Abloh) brings a pulse on sounds from around the globe and focus on the best possible live delivery of music. The music-nerd duo plays the room… plays sounds, not songs. Same same, but different - play your opponent not the game. They know the best sounds for the room. Refreshing.. They trade control of the ball in real-time like a young #8 Kobe tosses cross-eyed Shaq an alley-oop in the NBA finals. It’s effortless but all SO deliberate. Virgil claims the two USB cord between their brains, i kind of believe that. I'm big on the importance of introductions - PARIS, IL introduced themselves a while back in the 2 hour set below</div>

The second thing I noticed was a transition from some song to “young folks”. Now i’m really interested. 142 Sullivan deserves it’s own story and a lot more and Vane Russo is a big reason why. She bartends but it’s clear that her collage art makes her tick. The style of her collages are a direct reflection of her social DNA. Super pure. She makes one-of-ones and designed the entire bathroom in 142 Sullivan. I bought a piece from her this week and don’t expect to stop there.</div>
