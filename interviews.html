... painter vanard who used to have people sneak into the louvre to touch up paintings etc. (pre security era) ...

"build credibility to do something before you're good at it"
-v "that's the trick" ...

the definition of credibility will change ...

the idea of offering an update to classic things is post post modern. but i see the freedom in that and i think that can influence and make more impactful work ...

very clear core mission... real sense of elevating the normal looking at youth culture and not dictating to it but sharing the interests and learning from their feedback ...

maintain your own definitions of integrity as you're working with these entities in a sense

"the confines actually make the design"
- best quote ever, it's all about constraints and how structure creates flexibility
- virgil learns more in the feedback than he does just siting there mulling on it. can't just be my own voice ...

"i have a belief that positive vibes rule the world. so..." ...

"little ideas that you see that resonate on a tech front" ...

"what i do love about hypebeast is that we can make trends happen" ... "Selling t shirts into water to poor people" ...

right balance between telling and doing
always rationalize... only like lightly referencing - so much doing and not enough time for the story telling. story telling is important and it's a tool to communicate to large masses of people who aren't controlled by a voice. not edited ...

every older gate keeper in every industry -- don't give the kids the information, don't let them into the luxury store, this is high art, not for you... one of the bullet points of this modern culture is that information is free ...

"jokes turn into brands" it's not "art work" it influences and it's ironic + connects to the public... irony is our generation's humor ...

"discipline is the refining fire by which talent becomes ability" </p>

			...you’re self conscious about your art, about your work, and so you want to send all your work to friends or you want to send it to contacts that you have that are trying to do a similar thing and have those same emotions. But once you’re confident with it, you just get to a point where it’s like, you don’t need that validation, you don’t need affirmation about your work. You just do exactly what your vision is, exactly what you see is going to be the best for what you’re writing. So, I don’t really fuck with that many other writers...

			...a good designer will know how to channel what you want. That’s what the culture of the studio is. I always go back to feedback, because it’s the response, and feed- back even includes the audience: people that use your products or view your products, listen to them, whatever your art is...

			...always go to work before you check your email or read the New York Times. You spend eight hours with your subconscious dreaming. Don’t waste that by taking the world in, go out. So immediately write in your journal, make ceramics, but do something that’s out instead of taking in. It’s an essential survival tool for all creative people. Instead of checking your email with one eye...

			...you gotta get what you want out of any situation. You gotta be an asshole about it. You gotta utilize resources to the most of your ability. Sometimes a label might not wanna give you them. One time they tried to do that to Dipset and Cam took a fire extinguisher and started spraying everyone in the office. He was going off. And they got what they wanted...

			...[laughing] I'll just cold call people, absolutely. I'll just cold call people and pick their brain about stuff. Some of the questions that I'll ask will seem really, really simple and stupid, quite honestly, for them. But if I don't know, I don't know. You have to ask. I'll just do that. I'll just ask questions and I want to know more about how they build their businesses and how they run their companies and how they see the world...
