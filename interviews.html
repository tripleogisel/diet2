			Virgil on meeting Takashi for the first time
			<br>
			Avg Chicago kid who knew he was thinking about the shit Kanye's doing before he was even doing it... like they were long lost brothers... working west loop arch firm but really talking to kanye during lunch etc., called, working graduation, do you have a passport? can you fly to tokyo?
...
			"Let's make this the best possible"
...
			"We're a collective"

			... same as always
<br>
			favorite room in Murakami exhibit <br> ...
			ME (marc ecko)
			yea - we all remember that place creatively where you're like "uhhhhhhhhh" in a dessert and you go from all that x to y
...
<br>
<a class="quoteMarkButton" href="https://medium.com/@tripleOGisel/issa-new-idea-perfectly-imperfect-stream-of-conscious-writing-on-takashi-murakami-artistic-dfa32abd9a4c
			">th-oughts</a> When Takashi Murakami shows the first room
...
<br>
Makes tM so accessible
<br>
"Hot dog magazine as inspiration for complex dual cover front/back"
...
"When Source wasn't enough"
...
			Virgil on life 1993
			Uncanny love for t shirts and graphics and someone was explaining it to him because Steve jobs staff has shirts. Validating the t shirt as a form of graphic design at a young age ...
<br>
			"I don't know how to be an artist I know how to create"
...
			These aren't just t shirts
<br>
			How'd you learn illustrator?
			Edjucation is this thing that you have to do - you're on a track and you're just supposed to stay on it who knows where that last stop is... from Ghana just happy to be on some fucking tracks... always wanted to add stuff to education to make it interesting to him... has the one graffiti "subway art" book... learned who caravaggio, taking art history, taking architecture, meets young dude who says "gonna teach you photoshop, illustrator and how to design a web page as your get out of jail free cards"
...
			immediately obsessed with making t shirts - takes 1 guy 24hrs design -> tangible vs. building takes 100 guys 100 hrs design -> new pencil design
<br>
			"Control c is copy control v is paste"
<br>
			Subway art the book
<br>
			Virgil asking ME on top 3 steps to become the artist version of a wall st. montauk type "baller" that doesn't suck
<br>
			Mark talks hip hop exposure
...
			Airbrushedqx tees was step 1 how he inserted into the rap game
...
			King fade started shirt kings - ll cool j airbrush of himself on a tee - one of one to one of many transition via silk screen was 1991 vs airbrush up until then as echo vs. ecko... nerds don't fight
...
<br>
			Virgil
			Via leraning by doing. Everyone you talk to has a varied background... open source info back to the room
...
			From copy and paste to solo shows
...

			Virgil ... there's so much opportunity the glory days are over etc blah blah blah and that's all a product of a system of old people trying to supress creativity and preserve their ways etc.
<br>
			It sounds brush but I figured it out ... "just do it"... "i guarantee you're not doing it"
<br>
			Hip hop as a product of a lack of resources ... like this a lot
<br>
			Everyone participating right now, Virgil, he's part of a generation. It's like describing any other part of art history - "renaissance" - "Impressionism" - except do they happen // transition more rapidly today than in the past??
<br>
			Think it do it and then imagine what it's going to be in 10-20 years. Find consign in the work because it brings more work
<br>
			Freezing it in an institution for a generation to see. That's what I want to make
...
			Marcell duschamp ... key guy Virgil took art history late in the game of school and it blew his mind that caravaggio invented a style... learning things at a certain ti me..
<br>

			On Looking fresh-
			That's not illegal it's the vibe ...
<br>
			Virgil literally Trojan horsed being charitable and then brought it back to the south side
<br>
			CRED creating real economic destiny
<br>
			Very reactionary looks at everything that's happening
...

			What is it and what is it not? how does it stand out... ?
...
			Worst thing you can do is not be varied ... if not through an institution
...
			Smart is the new luxury - sometimes the blunt shit that hurts is the most important part of the gauntlet
...
			Virgil to finish it off

			That's what art is ... it's 4 walls the protect ideas ... scared places to hold ideas it's over the lineage...

			No outward feedback makes him feel happy

			Audience driven talks are the future where the speakers as questions of the crowd and then talk etc etc
<br>
			"How much does education cost?"
			- Virgil

			I’m more interested in places that make people feel like they’ve seen them before, but can’t say exactly where. Same goes for people — I like those who are slightly off or hard to grasp.

			that's what's funny now is that it's all there, but, you choose who you follow, what you follow, what you click on... but if only you choose... and you keep it on that level... i don't know... there are reasons why there were mentorships and all the great philosophers studied under people... socrates with plato and aristotle... whatever, essentially he's like 'click on this' knowledge of self... @ about 8mins

... painter vanard who used to have people sneak into the louvre to touch up paintings etc. (pre security era) ...

"build credibility to do something before you're good at it"
-v "that's the trick" ...

the definition of credibility will change ...

the idea of offering an update to classic things is post post modern. but i see the freedom in that and i think that can influence and make more impactful work ...

very clear core mission... real sense of elevating the normal looking at youth culture and not dictating to it but sharing the interests and learning from their feedback ...

maintain your own definitions of integrity as you're working with these entities in a sense

"the confines actually make the design"
- best quote ever, it's all about constraints and how structure creates flexibility
- virgil learns more in the feedback than he does just siting there mulling on it. can't just be my own voice ...

"i have a belief that positive vibes rule the world. so..." ...

"little ideas that you see that resonate on a tech front" ...

"what i do love about hypebeast is that we can make trends happen" ... "Selling t shirts into water to poor people" ...

right balance between telling and doing
always rationalize... only like lightly referencing - so much doing and not enough time for the story telling. story telling is important and it's a tool to communicate to large masses of people who aren't controlled by a voice. not edited ...

every older gate keeper in every industry -- don't give the kids the information, don't let them into the luxury store, this is high art, not for you... one of the bullet points of this modern culture is that information is free ...

"jokes turn into brands" it's not "art work" it influences and it's ironic + connects to the public... irony is our generation's humor ...

"discipline is the refining fire by which talent becomes ability" </p>

			...you’re self conscious about your art, about your work, and so you want to send all your work to friends or you want to send it to contacts that you have that are trying to do a similar thing and have those same emotions. But once you’re confident with it, you just get to a point where it’s like, you don’t need that validation, you don’t need affirmation about your work. You just do exactly what your vision is, exactly what you see is going to be the best for what you’re writing. So, I don’t really fuck with that many other writers...

			...a good designer will know how to channel what you want. That’s what the culture of the studio is. I always go back to feedback, because it’s the response, and feed- back even includes the audience: people that use your products or view your products, listen to them, whatever your art is...

			...always go to work before you check your email or read the New York Times. You spend eight hours with your subconscious dreaming. Don’t waste that by taking the world in, go out. So immediately write in your journal, make ceramics, but do something that’s out instead of taking in. It’s an essential survival tool for all creative people. Instead of checking your email with one eye...
